    <h1>Reclaiming city
streets for people
Chaos or quality of life?</h1>
    The quality of the environment in urban areas is of vital importance. It is one of the main factors that determine whether a city is a healthy
place to live, whether we enjoy living there, and whether we want
our children to grow up there.
One of the key issues affecting the quality of the environment and the
quality of life in our towns and cities is road traffic. Heavy motor traffic
means poor air quality, unacceptable levels of noise and a weakened sense
of neighbourhood and local community. Traffic also gives rise to high costs
for the economy through delays caused by congestion.
Every year more than 3 million cars are added to the car fleet in Europe.
Total road traffic kilometres in urban areas will grow by 40 % between 1995
and 2030. Local authorities and citizens need to decide how to respond to
these pressures and decide what sort of place they want their town or city to
be in the future. One option is to try to eliminate congestion by building
more roads, but the costs — financial, social and environmental — can be
high and the relief short-lived. More and more cities are opting for a
different approach where they work together with their citizens to ensure
that they have access to the goods and services they need without having to
depend on road traffic.
There are many traffic management techniques and approaches and any
given city will probably need to develop a package of measures to manage
traffic effectively. This new handbook sets out some case studies where road
space has been reallocated for other uses. New, attractive and popular public
areas can be created on sites that were once blocked by regular traffic jams.
If these are properly planned, they need not result in road traffic chaos,
contrary to what might be expected.

<h1>Bijlmer: City of the Future</h1>
In 1933, a group of architects boarded a ship and set sail from Marseille, France to Athens, Greece. On board were several of the world’s most famous modernist architects and artists, including Erno Goldfinger, Le Corbusier, Alvar Alto, and dozens of others.


There was a silent film made of the voyage that shows the architects on the deck in short-sleeved white shirts and sunglasses. The cruise was the setting for the International Congress of Modern Architecture, commonly known by its French acronym, CIAM.


Ville Radieuse plan by Le Corbusier
The subject of this particular congress was city-planning. The members of CIAM thought that cities were too congested, noisy, polluted and chaotic. And they believed some of these problems could be solved by separating out the functions of a city into distinct zones for housing, working, recreation, and traffic.

Zoning wasn’t a new idea, but the architects from CIAM wanted to take it farther. The living spaces would be in high-rise apartments so that the ground-level was open for recreation and collective spaces— live in the sky, play on the ground. Cars would even drive on elevated roads so that pedestrians could have the space below all to themselves. There would also be separate districts for industry and shopping. Where old European cities were winding, cluttered and polluted, this new one would be linear, open, and clean, with everything in its proper place.


Pedestrians and cars on different levels in ideal city as envisioned by Le Corbusier
Modernists also saw this new kind of city as capable of providing more egalitarian conditions. They wanted beautiful housing that everyone could afford. They had big dreams, but the 1930s was a time of worldwide economic depression. But the rebuilding that followed the Second World War provided a chance to start over.





Le Corbusier with students and models of (unbuilt) urban design proposals

In 1943, the Swiss architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier) published a book called Charte d’Athènes (The Athens Charter). It outlined exactly how to build new cities in the way the architects from CIAM had talked about back in 1933. Le Corbusier traveled the world talking about these utopian ideas for city building, and governments liked what they heard — not so much for the utopian ideals, but rather for the price, because what Corbusier proposed was, in fact, very cheap. Concrete, the Modernist building material of choice, was inexpensive, and building apartments in high-rises required less land than building stand-alone homes.


Original master plan for the Bijlmemeer (or Bijlmer for short)
After the war, developments all over the world were built with CIAM’s modernist principles in mind, although they weren’t all pure expressions of CIAM and Le Corbusier’s ideas. Many cities took some of the ideas and left others. But the city planners of Amsterdam wanted to go further. They decided to build a new neighborhood, close to Amsterdam, that would be a CIAM blueprint — a perfect encapsulation of Modernist principles. It was called the Bijlmermeer, and it tested these ideas on a grand scale. When it was over, no one would ever try it again.



Pi de Bruijn was an architect in Amsterdam who, as a young man, was hired to help plan the Bijlmermeer. The  utopian ideals of the project captured de Bruijn’s attention for seven years, as he worked as part of a team headed by an architect named Siegfried Nassuth. Nassuth was an idealist who felt the cities of the past had failed and needed to be rebuilt from scratch, using the modernist principles developed by CIAM.

There was never any question that the so-called Bijlmer (short for Bijlmermeer) would be made of tall concrete housing towers, but they did choose to arrange them in the unique shape of a honeycomb.



The hexagonal grid would allow each apartment to get some sunlight every day. The apartments were meant for the middle class, and no apartment was designed to be “better” than another. Every man would be equal to his neighbor. At one point, Pi de Bruijn proposed to have apartments on the ground, but lead architect Siegfried Nassuth would have none of it. The ground was meant to be a collective space for everyone, according to the principles of modernism.



When the first few buildings were finished in the late 1960s, advertisements depicted a paradise with modern apartment towers, surrounded by lush green grass and trees. De Bruijn and his wife moved into the complex in 1969. “I lived on the 9th floor,” he recalls, and “I had a four-room apartment: three bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, beautiful bathroom, and a balcony that was two meters wide and twelve meters long. It was a paradise of a balcony.”

But there were also some immediate problems at the Bijlmer. A metro line was supposed to connect the new area with Amsterdam, but construction was delayed. For a while, there was only one dirt road leading out to the area. The designers had planned for a shopping area, but the shops didn’t come right away either, which meant there was nowhere to buy groceries.

Eventually the roads did begin to appear, and they were elevated above the ground, weaving in and out of the high rises. Driving through provided a spectacular view, but it was difficult to navigate or orient around a center, because there was nothing like a city center or town square — there were just identical concrete buildings arranged in a honeycomb formation. And there was no one to ask for directions, because there were no pedestrians on the elevated streets. De Bruijn complained about all of this, but his superiors told him to wait.

And so de Bruijn waited, and waited. Other residents were not as patient.  Disillusion set in and the waiting lists disappeared.

By the early 1970’s, as the Bijlmer was still being built, much of the world was already turning against the massive concrete apartment towers that modernists had pushed for in the 30s and 40s.

EPISODE 44
The Pruitt-Igoe Myth
Pruitt Igoe in St Louis, had also been an experiment in the modernist principles of CIAM — it was constructed in 1954, and by the mid 1970s  it was already so overrun with vacancies and crime that the city tore it down. The American urban planner Oscar Newman had theorized that it was the vast amount of common spaces that had lead to Pruitt Igoe’s downfall — these neglected spaces had become hiding places for criminals. He worried that the Bijlmer was likely to suffer the same fate.

Even members of CIAM were starting to question and denounce this approach to building. The famous Dutch architect and CIAM member Aldo Van Eyck went on national TV and cried literal tears over what an awful concrete monstrosity Bijlmer was. Architect Rem Koolhaas said of the Bijlmermeer that it “offers boredom on heroic scale.”


Bijlmer as seen from above
Still, more buildings went up — massive concrete structures with around 400 apartments in each one. The Bijlmer steadily grew, even as the housing association that controlled the buildings had trouble finding enough tenants. In the end, 31 buildings went up, holding 13,000 apartments, though hundreds sat empty.

In addition to all the buildings there were also 13,000 storage spaces on the ground level, 31 parking garages, hundreds of elevators and staircases and common spaces and 110 kilometers or 68 miles of indoor ground-level corridors. There was so much space, and not enough people to fill it up, or watch over it.

Yet there were still people who needed housing. In fact, there were thousands of newly arrived citizens, who had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean and needed a place to live.

The Bijlmer would be that place.

<h1>More than 100 cities now mostly powered by renewable energy, data shows</h1>
The number of cities getting at least 70% of their total electricity supply from renewable energy has more than doubled since 2015

The number of cities reporting they are predominantly powered by clean energy has more than doubled since 2015, as momentum builds for cities around the world to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.

Data published on Tuesday by the not-for-profit environmental impact researcher CDP found that 101 of the more than 570 cities on its books sourced at least 70% of their electricity from renewable sources in 2017, compared to 42 in 2015.

Nicolette Bartlett, CDP’s director of climate change, attributed the increase to both more cities reporting to CDP as well as a global shift towards renewable energy.

The data was a “comprehensive picture of what cities are doing with regards to renewable energy,” she told Guardian Cities.

That large urban centres as disparate as Auckland, Nairobi, Oslo and Brasília were successfully moving away from fossil fuels was held up as evidence of a changing tide by Kyra Appleby, CDP’s director of cities.

“Reassuringly, our data shows much commitment and ambition,” she said in a statement. “Cities not only want to shift to renewably energy, but, most importantly – they can.”

Much of the drive for climate action at city level in the past year has been spurred on by the global covenant of more than 7,400 mayors that formed in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

Burlington, Vermont, was the only US city reporting to CDP that sourced all of its power from renewable sources after having fully transitioned in 2015. Research from the Sierra Club states there are five such cities in the US in total.

Burlington is now exploring how to become zero-carbon.

Mayor Miro Weinberger said to CDP that its shift to a diverse mix of biomass, hydro, wind and solar power had boosted the local economy, and encouraged other cities to follow suit. Across the US 58 towns and cities, including Atlanta and San Diego, have set a target of 100% renewable energy.

In Britain, 14 more cities and towns had signed up to the UK100 local government network’s target of 100% clean energy by 2050, bringing the total to 84. Among the recent local authority recruits were Liverpool City Region, Barking and Dagenham, Bristol, Bury, Peterborough, Redcar and Cleveland.

But the CDP data showed 43 cities worldwide were already entirely powered by clean energy, with the vast majority (30) in Latin America, where more cities reported to CDP and hydropower is more widespread.

In the six months to July, Latin American cities reported having instigated $183m of renewable energy projects – less than Europe ($1.7bn) or Africa ($236m). Europe topped the list for projects open for investment, but laid claim to just 20% of the 101 cities to be predominantly powered by clean energy.

The Icelandic capital Reyjkavik, sourcing all electricity from hydropower and geothermal, was among them. It is now working to make all cars and public transit fossil-free by 2040.

<h1>Model City</h1>
uring the depths of the Depression in the late 1930s, 300 craftspeople came together for two years to build an enormous scale model of the City of San Francisco. This Works Progress Administration (WPA) project was conceived as a way of putting artists to work while also creating a planning tool for the city to imagine its future.





The massive work was meant to remain on public view for all to see, but World War II broke out and the 6,000 piece, hand-carved and painted wooden model was put into storage for almost 80 years.



This audio story of an almost forgotten, three-dimensional, freeze-frame model of 1938 San Francisco features poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, historian Gary Kamiya, writer Maya Angelou as well as current “Keeper of the Model” Stella Lochman and more.



Understanding the model’s history involves traveling back to the Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure Island where it was first put on display in 1939, plus a trip to Angel Island with San Francisco Jazz Poet Laureate Genny Lim, a ridealong with bicycle historians Chris Carlsson and LisaRuth Elliott of Shaping San Francisco and a conversation with  geographer Gray Brechin, who helped save the model.


The Kitchen Sisters originally produced this story for SFMOMA’s Raw Material podcast in conjunction with their Public Knowledge program “Take Part” in which the museum partnered with the San Francisco Public Library and artists Bik Van Der Pol to engage the community in a series of talks and events around the model.

<h1>What would a truly walkable city look like?</h1>
rriving by Greyhound coach in Phoenix, Arizona, one November evening I was faced with either six hours waiting in the terminal or a one-mile walk with my wheelie suitcase to a nearby shuttle bus. I soon learned that simple-sounding walk was alongside a fast, unlit road with no pavement. Forced to take a taxi ($15 minimum fare) the Cameroonian driver and I talked incredulously as we watched the gravel and grass verge – perfectly wide enough for a sidewalk – drift past into the night.

The modern obsession with autonomous and electric vehicles, dockless scooters and bicycles means it is easy to forget the humble pedestrian. However, as almost every journey starts or finishes on foot, we are ignoring a fundamental part of what makes a city great.

Q&A
What is Walking the City week?

Susan Claris, associate director of transport consulting at the design and planning company Arup, says much can be done quickly and simply. “That for me is the joy of walkability,” she says. “There are so many things that can be done … it just takes someone to get on and do it.”

More than 270,000 people on foot are killed on the world’s roads every year, according to the WHO.
The UK walking charity Living Streets says because such details have so long been neglected, cities with ambitions for pedestrians should appoint a walking champion, alongside tougher moves to tackle air pollution and reduce motor traffic volumes and the biggest road safety risk factor: speed. They say low emissions charging zones or smart road pricing, along with enforcement of 20mph speed limits, could help fund people-friendly city centres and safe routes to schools.

Skye Duncan of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (Nacto), an association of 62 major North American cities and 10 transport agencies, says cities have long been asking the wrong question – how can we move cars? – when they should be asking: how can we move people?

“Pedestrians haven’t been put at the heart of cities,” she adds. “Fundamentally it’s pretty difficult to make a great city without great walking conditions.”

Auckland: the economics of shared streets

Notoriously car-centric Auckland in New Zealand recently published a report showing pedestrians as the most economically important transport mode in the city. They estimated that policies which put people off walking on Queen Street, a major shopping area, cost NZ$11.7m (£5.9m) a year.

Shared areas were created in and around Fort Street, a mixed commercial and residential area in the central business district. The city replaced car parking on some streets with trees and outdoor seating, and removed bollards and kerbs that had separated cars from pedestrians. The moves created more space for open-air activities, and made clear accessible routes for the visually impaired.

This new pedestrian network, at a cost of NZ$23m, increased pedestrian volumes by 54% and consumer spending by 47%. Meanwhile, the number of vehicles fell by 25% – and 80% said they felt safer in the area.

Bruno Royce, who conducted a safety review of the scheme, says shared spaces aren’t suitable everywhere, but can be a useful first step towards full pedestrianisation. Despite the changes he says some cars still travelled above 22kph, higher than the 10kph ideal. He would like to see the city narrowing or “kinking” the shared space to slow cars, or ban cars completely for part of the day.

London: machine learning

The City of London has some of the highest pedestrian concentrations in the world, with 51% of people moving on foot in just 9% of the road space. Added to that are huge numbers of people on bicycles – the City’s largest transport mode during the morning peak.

What we are trying to do is stop the awkward dance

The City of London Corporation recently banned all but buses, bicycles and pedestrians on weekdays from its notorious dangerous Bank junction (pictured above) – the site of 107 casualties including two deaths between 2012 and 2016.

On nearby Queen Street it is looking to reduce conflict between people on bikes and on foot in a busy shared space. Almere Technology is tracking and analysing interactions using cameras and machine learning software.

“What we are trying to do is stop the awkward dance,” says Almere Technology’s Tom Bailey, describing the point at which a pedestrian and cyclist interact, and one or both move aside.

“At less than three-quarters of a metre from pedestrians, generally the perception of conflict increases. The classic complaint is ‘these cyclists are travelling too fast’ but what does too fast mean in that context?”

Against baseline data the will trial different interventions, from “slow down” signs to separate bike lanes. Surveys of pedestrians and cyclists will help determine which works best.

Hanoi: safer spaces for women

Safe public toilets are something Susan Claris of Arup calls a “huge indicator of a civilised, walkable city”. In Vietnam, Action Aid found 87% of women and girls had experienced sexual harassment in public places, and that they felt least safe in public toilets, many of which have unisex entrances, as well as on buses.

Action Aid, Plan International and UN Women are developing pilot locations in cities across the country to test different interventions, such as street lighting.

Action Aid launched an app called S-City for people to report how safe or unsafe they feel on the street, in the workplace, or in schools, buses or public toilets. A map of the crowdsourced safety data helps others choose the safest route. The data will also be used to monitor how cities are performing and call for improvements.

Manchester: a walking network
A visualisation of Chapel Street, Salford, under the Manchester Beelines scheme
A useable network of high-quality paths is key for a pedestrian-friendly city. Greater Manchester has recently announced a 1,000-mile £160m walking and cycling grid, including 1,400 safer road crossings, improved footways and 25 “filtered neighbourhoods” which prioritise people on bike and on foot over cars, and featuring places to sit, play and socialise. When completed, Beelines will be the UK’s biggest connected walking and cycling network.

Work will be overseen by Greater Manchester’s walking and cycling commissioner, the former Olympic gold medal cyclist Chris Boardman, in collaboration with the city’s 10 local authorities. Boardman wants the network to work for people of all ages, and talks about a “double buggy test” for pavement widths, and avoiding shared pavements with cycles.

Denver: ‘what’s wrong with the sidewalks?’

When people move to Denver, Colorado, from places like New York, “they’re, like, ‘What’s wrong with the sidewalks? Why is it so hard to walk here?’,” says Jill Locantore.

At the current funding rate it would take 440 years to complete all the sidewalks in Denver

Jill Locantore
She is a campaigner for Walk Denver, a small team which runs anything from pop-up seating areas and traffic calming to pedestrian way-pointing signs.

In 2015 Walk Denver delivered a 3,000-strong better sidewalks petition, which helped push city hall into improving its pavements. A report found 40% of sidewalks were missing or too narrow for wheelchairs – and that rose to 47% in low-income neighbourhoods.

The city allocated $30m to improve sidewalks – although an estimated $1bn is needed. “At the current funding rate it would take 440 years to complete all the sidewalks in Denver,” says Locantore.

Denver residents are responsible for maintaining sidewalks outside their homes, but a new funding programme could help out.

Locantore would also like to see more trees, lighting, slower traffic and safety improvements to the most dangerous streets. A prime candidate is Federal Boulevard, the site of half of Denver’s 14 pedestrian deaths last year.

Addis Ababa: slower speeds, narrower car lanes
Sebategna Intersection in Addis Ababa – before and after
In Ethiopia’s capital city 70% of all trips are on foot, and only 4% by car. Pedestrians account for 80% of the city’s almost 500 annual road deaths.

A safe intersections programme aims to halve Addis Ababa traffic injuries and fatalities by 2023. Sebategna intersection, beside Africa’s largest market, Mercato, was transformed late last year with planters and floor paint, on a six-month trial basis – the picture above shows it before and after changes were made. Ten city junctions will be similarly transformed annually, for the next three years.

An earlier transformation of LeGare intersection successfully reduced vehicle turning speeds from 30kph to 18.5kph. Broad central pedestrian refuges and pavements reduced crossing distances from 50m to as little as 6.5m. The result: people felt safer, and more of them used the improved crossings. An underpass would have cost 500-time more, Nacto estimates.

San Francisco: somewhere to meet and rest
The Public Bench Project aims to give a bench to anybody in San Francisco who requests one.
Chris Duderstadt has placed 115 public benches around San Francisco since the he started his project in the 1970s. He hand-builds, paints and delivers the benches for free or a small donation, giving the community somewhere to meet and rest. He even shares his design so others can do the same.

“They make a neighbourhood much friendlier,” he says. “With an hour and a half I can make a bench. It gives me joy, it gives other people joy.”

If the proposed location is suitable, Duderstadt paints them to fit in – he painted an “emmental yellow” bench outside a cheese shop – or tailors them according to requests from hosts who “adopt” them.

The benches sometimes attract homeless people, and criticism. If that happens Duderstadt says he or the hosts will help rough sleepers get in touch with local services, and will remove the bench for a period.

“I’ve had a bench in front of my house for 40 years and, generally speaking, people that sit on the bench are respectful,” he says. “It builds communities. Sometimes the people who use them don’t smell good, but that’s life.”

<h1>Pedestrian Cities / Quality of Life</h1>
Designing great places for the comfort and enjoyment of the pedestrian is one of the most important aspects of New Urbanism. Taken to the highest level of urbanism, the finest places in the world are cities with entire networks of car-free streets, known as pedestrian cities.




Pedestrian cities are growing in popularity in many top regions around the world. The incredible beauty, enjoyment, and convenience a network of connected pedestrian streets and squares provides to the residents on a daily basis is unsurpassed. Being able to walk to a mix of shops, restaurants, newsstands, coffeehouses and open-air markets within car-free neighborhoods and work centers delivers the highest quality of life, and adds great variety and vitality to an area. Jane Jacobs calls this "an intricate and close-grained diversity of uses that give each other constant mutual support, both economically and socially." There is a growing demand for entire city districts to be made pedestrian, and directly connected to a train line.



Venice
Venice, Italy is considered the greatest pedestrian city in the world because it contains the largest pedestrian street network completely free of cars. The entire city has no cars operating on its streets. The city is quite dense, yet the most relaxing and pleasant city in the world.

Copenhagen is another of the world’s great pedestrian cities. A recent issue of 'Metropolis' magazine talks about Copenhagen and its growing pedestrian street network. Although it’s blessed with certain inherited characteristics - such as a narrow medieval street grid - the city has worked steadily to improve the quality of its street life. In the 40 years since Copenhagen’s main street was turned into a pedestrian thoroughfare, city planners have taken numerous small steps to transform the city from a car-oriented place to a people-friendly one. “In Copenhagen, we have pioneered a method of systematically studying and recording people in the city,” says Jan Gehl, a Danish architect and co-author of ‘Public Spaces-Public Life’, a study on what makes the city’s urban spaces work. “After twenty years of research, we’ve been able to prove that these steps have
